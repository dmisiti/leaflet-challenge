# Module 15 Challenge - Leaflet

In this challenge, JavaScript and Leaflet were utilized to build a visualization of earthquake data from the United States Geological Survey (USGS).

The earthquake data represented in this visualization compiles all earthquakes of magnitude 1.0 or greater that were recorded globally in the past 7 days (from the time of accessing the data). The data was accessed from the [USGS GeoJSON Feed](http://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/feed/v1.0/geojson.php).

Leaflet was used to create a map that plots all the earthquakes from the dataset based on their latitude and longitude.

The app displaying the earthquake map is found in the `index.html` file.

The "static" folder contains a "css" folder and a "js" folder. 
- In the "css" folder, the `style.css` file can be found.
- In the "js" folder, the `logic.js` file can be found, which shows the JavaScript used for creating the visualization.
